    <h4>Sweet Nothing - Calvin harris & Florence Welch</h4>
    <audio controls src="songs/Calvin Harris - Sweet Nothing (Official Video) ft. Florence Welch.mp3"></audio><br>
    <strong>Letra abaixo:</strong><br>
    You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth<br>
    And with a word all my love came rushing out<br>
    And every whisper, it's the worst<br>
    Emptied out by a single word<br>
    There is a hollow in me now<br>
    <br>
    So I put my faith in something unknown<br>
    I'm living on such sweet nothing<br>
    But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold<br>
    I'm living on such sweet nothing<br>
    And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love<br>
    When you're giving me such sweet nothing<br>
    Sweet nothing, sweet nothing<br>
    You're giving me such sweet nothing<br>
    <br>
    It isn't easy for me to let it go<br>
    Cause I've swallowed every single word<br>
    And every whisper, every sigh<br>
    Eats away at this heart of mine<br>
    And there is a hollow in me now<br>
    <br>
    So I put my faith in something unknown<br>
    I'm living on such sweet nothing<br>
    But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold<br>
    I'm living on such sweet nothing<br>
    And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love<br>
    When you're giving me such sweet nothing<br>
    Sweet nothing, sweet nothing<br>
    You're giving me such sweet nothing<br>
    <br>
    And it's not enough to tell me that you care<br>
    When we both know the words are empty air<br>
    You give me nothing<br>
    Nothing<br>
    <br>
    Woah, woah, woah<br>
    Sweet nothing<br>
    Woah, woah, woah<br>
    Sweet nothing<br>
    <br>

    <strong>Letra abaixo:</strong><br>
    My only peace of mind<br>
    Please, tell me<br>
    It's by your side<br>
    <br>
    Do you know some place, where I can hide<br>
    From all of the highs and all of the lows?<br>
    The place where I will find, my only peace of mind<br>
    Please, tell me it's by your side<br>
    <br>

    <strong>Letra abaixo:</strong><br>
    I remember how we used to be so beautiful<br>
    You broke my heart at 16<br>
    The first time I felt my world come crashing<br>
    Black magic, like your heart was made of matches<br>
    And I never got over it<br>
    <br>
    I swear your friends know when to post your photograph<br>
    It doesn’t really hurt, but it always takes me back to 16<br>
    In your basement and your parents, my feelings<br>
    And I never got over it<br>
    <br>
    How did you break my heart without even trying?<br>
    How are you on my mind? You're not even talking to me<br>
    You were made of matches, and you burned me to the ground<br>
    You were made of matches, and you burned me down<br>
    <br>
    Everybody says that you're still living your life<br>
    One weekend to the next still tryna' get it right<br>
    The truth is I worry you never found something to escape who you used to be<br>
    <br>
    I found my own way of coping with your mess<br>
    And I found my own reasons why you weren't the best for me<br>
    Why couldn't you be the best for me?<br>
    <br>
    How did you break my heart without even trying?<br>
    How are you on my mind? You're not even talking to me<br>
    You were made of matches, and you burned me to the ground<br>
    You were made of matches, and you burned me down<br>
    <br>
    You were made of matches and you burned me down<br>
    I never got over it<br>
    I never got over it<br>
